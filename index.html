        My Skills</h1>
      <p>
        Having studied full-stack web development at CareerFoundry I gained a solid
        understanding of programming concepts, and have dedicated a lot of my free time to apply
        these concepts to real-world scenarios and applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that clean code, with easy to understand comments, is essential to
        make life easier for everyone involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some of the tools and technologies that I've worked with:

      <p>
        I love to keep learning and trying out new technologies. I find the best learning
        curve comes from attempting to solve practical problems. Here are some of the projects
        I've been focusing my energy on.

      <div class="project__item">
        <h1 class="hash">Meet App</h1>
        <p>
          A serverless, Progressive Web Application allowing users
          to search for events on Google Calender.
        </p>
        <div class="hidden-info">
          <p>
            Meet App was built with <span class="small-caps">REACT</span>. Users can search for events in different
            cities and choose the number of events to be displayed.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the start of this project I set up <span class="small-caps">AWS</span> Lambda and added the
            authentication code. This was a steep learning curve, and I got stuck
            for a while with a bug, but after some perserverence I managed to
            resolve it.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the build, unit, integration and end-to-end tests were implemented.
            Initially it seemed like a strange concept for me to write the tests before
            the actual code, but I appreciate how this can save time in the long-run.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were times when I would hit a problem, trying to get something
            to display a certain way, but there's nothing more satisfying than
            resolving it. And sometimes discovering a neat trick or a way to do
            things that was better than my original idea. There's always lots of
            cool stuff to learn!

        <p>
          A React Native App that allows users to chat, share images and a map of their location.

            This App uses Expo to run both on an online emulator and mobile. It's styled with

          </p>
          <p>
            This was an exciting project, to develop an online social media chat room! It was a great
            feeling when up and running and I could create chat messages between the emulator
            and my mobile.

      <p>
        Originally from England, I have bachelors degree in
        Politics, Philosopy and Economics, a diploma in
        hypnotherapy, and have spent a lot of time exploring meditation and yoga.
        I spent many years doing social work, supporting people with autism and learning
        disabilities.
        <br /><br />
        A few years ago I moved to Berlin with my family and decided to pursue
        a career in web development, out of a desire to be involved in helping
        to steer technology in a beneficial direction. And in July 2021 I completed
        a Full Stack Web-Development Bootcamp at CareerFoundry.
        <br /><br />
        I've always enjoyed creating, in a structured kind of way. Problem
        solving, making things fit, or work well, is somehow rewarding. I like
        that sense of completion, when things come together, to flow
        beautifully.
        <br /><br />
        Some years ago I studied carpentry, just for fun, and I love making functional, built-in
        furniture. I get that same feeling of being in the groove from programming, especially
        front-end, when playing around with the look of a website, until it feels just right.
        <br><br>
        I think in this modern, technological world, there's a chance to make
        an impact. The internet is a mega powerful tool, which can be
        harnessed for great things. And it's my hope that I can contribute my skills
        towards improving the world in some way.
        <br /><br />
        I love front-end development, have some knowledge of back-end and also enjoy
        dipping my toes into designing the user-interface. In the future I'd love to deepen my
        knowledge into the rules and tools of creating an easeful user experince.
        <br><br>
        Aside from programming, I also enjoy juggling, painting, writing and
        being in nature.
