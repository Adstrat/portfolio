            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This Application started as a JavaScript project to build a Pokédex App, fetching data from an external
              API
              to display Pokémon stats.
            </p>
            <p>
              While making the App I experimented with writing the code first in vanilla javaScript and then converted
              this
              to jQuery. For the navbar, modal components and layout I used Bootstrap.
            </p>

              After I completed this project I decided to expand the app and add a landing
              page, a quiz page and a game. I had fun experiementing with the CSS - like
              making the pokemon spin on hover on the index page and practiced DOM manipulation with the quiz.

        <h2>Coding Beyond Tutorials</h2>
        <p>
          This App was essentially about getting a better grip with JavaScript. For the Pokédex and Quiz pages I
          followed
          tutorials for the basic code, adapting the code to my personal needs. This helped me to understand and read
          code,
          but I wanted to take it to the next level and write code. So I decided to make a Pokémon game using my own
          ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started by having a basic idea - poke as many pokemon on the screen as you can in 10 seconds. I then
          researched how to
          determine random places on the game screen and used the console a lot to help me see what was going on. This
          really
          honed my JavaScript skills and forced me to think through the whole process independently. It also brought to
          my attention
          the need for event delegation to attach event listeners to elements created in the DOM, as this was vital to
          the
          structure of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end I wanted to create a screen for both mobile and desktop views, which required using media
          queries and figuring out ways to refactor the code.
        </p>

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        I love CSS and using JavaScript for DOM manipulation. For me playing around with the visual and interactive
        experience is primarily why I chose to get into Web Development and I fully intend to explore UI design concepts
        further.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is the foundation for learning so much about coding. Developing apps like Pokémon World have helped
        me to get a better grasp of the core concepts in programming which is essential to master other libraries and
        frameworks.
