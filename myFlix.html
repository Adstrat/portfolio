              To access this app I developed a login and registration page to set up a new account. Once logged in, the
              main page displays
              film cards which the user can explore.

              Users can choose to navigate to pages to read about each film, different genres and directors
              of the '80s era. They can also add films to a dynamic list of their favourites.
            </p>
            <p>
              They can also view their profile details, stored on mongoDB, where there's the option
              to update and delete their profile.

        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <p>
          This app was built using the <span class="small-caps">MERN</span> stack:
        </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>mongodb</li>
          <li>express</li>
          <li>react</li>
          <li>node.js</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It was split into two main projects - the back and front-end, which work together to bring the data
          through to visually experience the app.

          <h2>Back-End Development</h2>
          <p>
            The first part of the project involved developing a <span class="small-caps">REST</span>ful
            <span class="small-caps">API</span>
            and creating a <span class="small-caps">NoSQL</span> database. The <span class="small-caps">API</span>
            contains the logic for accessing
            both the data about each film and allowing users to create a secure, personal account.

        <h2>User Authentication</h2>
        <p>
          The user authentication process was the trickiest part of this project.
          Working on the back-end taught me a lot about the logic needed to maintain high standards
          of security. And the front-end required a lot of thought to implement effective error handling.

          <h2>Front-End Development</h2>
          <p>
            For the user interface I used <span class="small-caps">REACT</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            User Flow Diagrams helped me to map out how to arrange the props and states
            for each view.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both functional and class components were used along with React Bootstrap components. As well as using
            mongoDB for CRUD operations, local storage was used to keep the user logged in.

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        While I feel more confident with front-end development, I enjoyed developing the <span
          class="small-caps">API</span> and creating a
        database and would like to expand these skills in future projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project helped to solidify my React knowledge, such as using hooks and updating the states.
        At the end I successfully changed some of the states to be managed with Redux, just for practice. I feel
        this is something I'd like to explore more as it's important when working on bigger projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoyed working the most on the User Interface. Playing around with the <span class="small-caps">CSS</span>
        to see how different elements respond. This is a particular area that I intend to extend and explore as I
        continue on my web development journey.
